<h3>[icon name="comment-alt" style="regular"] Description</h3>
<p>The Aircam Aviation Series by Osprey was a series with lots of b+w photographs, a concise history of the aircraft and its operations and a color section with sideviews, aimed at the modeller.<br>
<br>
The Osprey Publishing company was formed to publish Aircam Aviation, its first series, the brainchild of Dick Ward, the leading aviation illustrator. The series grew out of his work on the collectable cards which were then packaged with Brooke Bond tea. The first Osprey book was published in 1969: Aircam Aviation Series.1: North American P-51D Mustang in USAAF-USAF Service. This set the Osprey style of illustrated information books combining detailed and authoritative text, colour and black & white artwork, and photographs in uniform series formats.<br>
<br>
With the success of Aircam, Dick Ward proposed applying the same approach to famous military units. Philip Warner, a distinguished historian from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, was appointed series editor and Men-at-Arms came into being. But the Aircam Aviation series will forever be looked at as one of their greatest achievements!<br></p>
