			<h3><i class="bi bi-chat-left-text-fill"></i> Description</h3>
			<p>The topic of each book is a prolonged air campaign. If you are interested in the Battle of Midway or the air attack on Taranto Harbor, you’ve come to the wrong place.  The air campaign over Malta lasted for two and half years.  Operation Rolling Thunder persisted from 1965-68.  These are just two examples, but all the remaining topics lasted weeks if not months or years.<br>
<br>
Each book lays out the objectives of the campaign, the forces facing each other (in case you need your ration of airplane nerdism.) They have great maps that break down bombing raids, because there are lots of those in a campaign.  Yes it includes a few of the color plates we’ve come to expect from Osprey, but not as many you might have come to expect.  But the real value of the book comes in telling the story of the campaign and the brief analysis that follows.  Lots of period photos with solid captions.  Each book is 96 pages including references and index.<br>
<br>
It’s a big picture look at a campaign.  They resist the temptation to focus too closely on one pilot’s anecdotal exploits, or on one air mission.  The story doesn’t bog down. New factors are introduced as part of the timeline as are the failures, successes, new players and changes in approach to the problem that must be solved.<br>
<br>
Packed with artwork, maps and diagrams, the Air Campaign series examines how the world’s greatest air wars have been fought. Analyzing the goals of the attacking air commanders, the aircraft they had to work with, the opposing air defences, how they planned the attack and how the pilots actually fought it, this series sheds light on why air campaigns have been won and lost.<br>
<br>
Each book contains:<br>
• Battlescene artwork<br>
• Aerial bird’s-eye views<br>
• Maps & 3D diagrams<br></p>
