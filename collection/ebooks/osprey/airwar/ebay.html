			<h3><i class="bi bi-chat-left-text-fill"></i> Description</h3>
			<p>In 1968, Osprey started its publishing with the “Arco-Aircam Aviation” series. This ran into the early 1970's. Incorporating a basic text, many photos, and many color profiles, this series was readily accepted by modelers; copies can still be found at used book shops, swap meets, and the like. <br>
<br>
Osprey’s publications are familiar to most modelers and include the Vanguard, Elite Warrior, Aircraft of the Aces, Elite Units, Combat Units, and Essential Histories, to name a few. But one series is near and dear to many modelers’ hearts: the “Airwar” series, issued between 1977 & 1979. By the early 1980s, this series had virtually disappeared from dealers’ shelves. Long out-of-print, Osprey has now reprinted those 24 volumes.<br>
<br>
A color art cover with useful detail <br>
Approx. 46 pp. of good text, with many, many good photos intermingled.<br>
A center color section containing:<br>
drawings of flight crew & one ground support person;<br>
3 side views of assorted aircraft;<br>
a color four-view of an aircraft;<br>
detail drawings of unit insignia, nose art, personal markings, etc.;<br>
<br>
No one, not even Osprey, has since attempted and succeeded in blending all the above factors into one coherent volume. Of necessity, the text is broad, but accurate. The drawing colors are accurate within the limitation of the printing process and the information available at the time. The uniforms are diverse–from mess dress, to work clothing, to flight crew dress, to other uniforms encountered. I consider the volumes on the Spanish Civil War, WW2 German Night Fighters, and RAF SEAC Units to be the best short introduction to these topics ever published. In short, these were/are great books to have.<br>
<br>
Certainly, these were/are not perfect. I’ve noticed some errors in drawings, especially with P-51s. Some information has been superseded in the last 25 years but not updated. (Each book has a disclaimer about this–that it has not been updated in light of newer information.) As a result, purists may turn down one or more of these volumes as it does NOT incorporate the latest research. Finally, if you do not have ANY of them, $14.95ea. + tax for the entire 24 volumes may well be price-prohibitive.<br>
<br>
But, if you have holes in your collection, now’s the time to fill same. If you passed these up in the 1970s or were too young to get them then and can afford to do so now, get them! You won’t be sorry. These volumes complement the newer Osprey aviation series.<br></p>
